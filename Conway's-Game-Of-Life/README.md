# Conway-s-Game-Of-Life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. <br/>
There is no interference in this game. <br/>
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. <br/>
The starting pattern should be created as in the Pattern.txt file. <br/>

## Game Rule

**1-** Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation. <br/>
**2-** Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. <br/>
**3-** Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation. <br/>
**4-** Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. <br/>
